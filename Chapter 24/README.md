# Exercies for Chapter 24

Use `stack ghci` to load code and execute functions

## Exercise 5.

Sorry, it is a bit of a mess. Here are the functions I created.

To verify that the logs are parsing correctly run: `parserTests`

For some summing tests run: `ChapterExercises_5.testSectionSum`

Summary of the time for each activity in the example log. `ChapterExercises_5.printSumTimeForEachActivity`

I had to be a little picky about how I was generating my Arbitrary data, but I was able to satisfy a bi-directional parsing test. See the function `ChapterExercises_5.testBidirectionalParsing`.
