module ChapterExercises where

import State

-- 1. Construct a State where the state is also the value you return.

get :: Moi s s
get =  Moi (\s -> (s,s))

-- 2. Construct a State where the resulting state is the argument provided and
--    the value is defaulted to unit.

put :: s -> Moi s ()
put s = Moi (\_ -> ((), s))

-- 3. Run the State with s and get the state that results.
exec :: Moi s a -> s -> s
exec (Moi sa) s = snd (sa s)

-- 4. Run the State with s and get the value that results.
eval :: Moi s a -> s -> a
eval (Moi sa) s = fst (sa s)

-- 5. Write a function which applies a function to create a new State.
modify :: (s -> s) -> Moi s ()
modify sToS = Moi $ \s -> ((), sToS s)
