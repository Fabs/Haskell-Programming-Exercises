1. not True && true

2. not (x = 6)

I'm not sure what the `x` is for but it needs to be the same type as `6`. `=` needs to be `==` for comparing the values.

3. (1 * 2) > 5

Seems fine to me. At least it compiles.

4. [Merry] > [Happy]

> questionFour = ["Merry"] > ["Happy"]

5. [1,2,3] ++ "look at me!"

> questionFive = ['1','2','3'] ++ "look at me!"
